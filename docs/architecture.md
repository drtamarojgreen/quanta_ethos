# System Architecture Overview

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture for the C++ Language Model (LLM) project. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable, allowing for future extensions and improvements.

## 2. Architectural Goals

*   **Modularity:** Components are designed to be independent and interchangeable.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle increasing loads by scaling components horizontally.
*   **Performance:** The core components are implemented in C++ for high performance and low latency.
*   **Extensibility:** The architecture should be easy to extend with new models, data sources, and APIs.

## 3. System Components

The system is composed of the following major components:

```
+-----------------+      +-----------------+      +-----------------+
|                 |      |                 |      |                 |
|   API Server    |<---->|  Core Engine    |<---->|  Model Backend  |
| (C++ REST SDK)  |      |   (C++)         |      | (C++ ONNX/TF)   |
|                 |      |                 |      |                 |
+-----------------+      +-----------------+      +-----------------+
        ^                        ^                        ^
        |                        |                        |
        v                        v                        v
+-----------------+      +-----------------+      +-----------------+
|                 |      |                 |      |                 |
|  Request/Resp.  |      |  Tokenization   |      |  Inference Eng. |
|  (JSON/gRPC)    |      |  (SentencePiece)|      |  (ONNX Runtime) |
|                 |      |                 |      |                 |
+-----------------+      +-----------------+      +-----------------+
```

### 3.1. API Server

*   **Description:** The public-facing entry point of the system. It handles incoming requests, authentication, and rate limiting.
*   **Technology:** C++ RESTful API server (e.g., using a library like `restinio` or `pistache`). It communicates with the Core Engine via a well-defined interface.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Exposing a RESTful or gRPC API.
    *   Validating and sanitizing user input.
    *   Forwarding requests to the Core Engine.
    *   Formatting the final response.

### 3.2. Core Engine

*   **Description:** The central component that orchestrates the entire process of generating a response.
*   **Technology:** C++.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Receiving requests from the API Server.
    *   Managing the lifecycle of a request.
    *   Coordinating between the Tokenizer, the Model Backend, and other services.
    *   Implementing the core business logic.

### 3.3. Model Backend

*   **Description:** This component is responsible for loading and running the LLM model.
*   **Technology:** C++ with a machine learning inference framework like ONNX Runtime or TensorFlow Lite.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Loading the pre-trained LLM model from disk.
    *   Performing inference on the input data.
    *   Returning the model's output to the Core Engine.

## 4. Data Flow

1.  A user sends a request to the **API Server**.
2.  The **API Server** validates the request and forwards it to the **Core Engine**.
3.  The **Core Engine** sends the input text to the **Tokenizer** to convert it into tokens.
4.  The **Core Engine** sends the tokens to the **Model Backend**.
5.  The **Model Backend** runs the LLM model and returns the generated output tokens.
6.  The **Core Engine** de-tokenizes the output and sends it back to the **API Server**.
7.  The **API Server** sends the final response to the user.

## 5. Technology Stack

*   **Programming Language:** C++ (17/20)
*   **Build System:** CMake
*   **API Framework:** restinio / pistache / gRPC
*   **Inference Engine:** ONNX Runtime / TensorFlow Lite
*   **Tokenizer:** SentencePiece
*   **Testing:** GTest
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions / Jenkins
