# Technical Documentation Roadmap
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Recommendation
**Prepared by:** Jules, C++ Systems Developer

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines a roadmap for creating essential technical documentation for this project. The existing documentation provides excellent guidance on the behavioral and ethical aspects of the LLM, but it lacks the technical details required for developers and system administrators to build, maintain, and extend the system.

The following documents are recommended to ensure the project is scalable, maintainable, and accessible to new contributors.

    *   Diagrams illustrating the relationships and data flow between components (e.g., using ASCII art or mermaid.js).
    *   Technology stack (e.g., C++ version, libraries, frameworks).
    *   Key design principles and patterns used.
*   **Audience:** New developers, system architects.

### 2.2. Developer's Guide (`developer_guide.md`)

*   **Purpose:** To provide a comprehensive guide for setting up a local development environment.
*   **Content:**
    *   Prerequisites (e.g., OS, compiler, tools).
    *   Step-by-step instructions for cloning the repository and installing dependencies.
    *   How to build the project from source.
    *   How to run the test suite.
    *   Guidelines for contributing code (e.g., branching strategy, pull request process).
*   **Audience:** Developers.

### 2.3. API Reference (`api_reference.md`)

*   **Purpose:** To document the public-facing API of the system.
*   **Content:**
    *   Detailed information on all public classes, methods, and functions.
    *   Parameters, return types, and potential exceptions for each API endpoint.
    *   Code examples demonstrating how to use the API.
    *   Information on authentication and rate limiting, if applicable.
*   **Audience:** Developers using the system as a library or service.

### 2.4. C++ Coding Style Guide (`coding_style.md`)

*   **Purpose:** To ensure code consistency and maintainability.
*   **Content:**
    *   Naming conventions (e.g., for variables, functions, classes).
    *   Formatting rules (e.g., indentation, brace style).
    *   Commenting standards.
    *   Best practices for C++ specific features (e.g., smart pointers, RAII).
    *   Guidance on handling errors and exceptions.
*   **Audience:** Developers contributing to the codebase.

### 2.5. Deployment Guide (`deployment_guide.md`)

*   **Purpose:** To explain how to deploy the application to various environments.
*   **Content:**
    *   Instructions for building a release version.
    *   Configuration for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
    *   Steps for deploying to target infrastructure (e.g., servers, cloud platforms).
    *   Information on containerization (e.g., Dockerfile).
*   **Audience:** System administrators, DevOps engineers.

### 2.6. Troubleshooting Guide (`troubleshooting.md`)

*   **Purpose:** To help users and developers resolve common issues.
*   **Content:**
    *   A list of frequently encountered problems.
    *   Step-by-step solutions for each problem.
