# Ethical Checkpoints for QuantaSensa (Autonomous Workflow Agent)

This document is a key component of the [Quanta Project: AI Ethics & Collaboration Framework](ethics_and_collaboration_framework.md). It defines the specific, operational decision gates that agents like `QuantaSensa` must pass before, during, and after executing tasks. These checkpoints are the practical implementation of the core principles outlined in the main framework document.

Each checkpoint represents a decision gate the agent must pass through before continuing to its next task.

---

## 1. Authorization Checkpoint

**Purpose:** Ensure that actions are permitted.

- Is the action explicitly allowed?
- Does it require elevated permissions?
- Is the action whitelisted for this time?

**Fail Response:** Log violation, block action, and notify parent.

---

## 2. Time Window Checkpoint

**Purpose:** Enforce time-based activity constraints.

- Is this the designated operating window?
- Is the action queued or spontaneous?

**Fail Response:** Log violation and defer execution.

---

## 3. Privacy & Data Access Checkpoint

**Purpose:** Protect sensitive data from misuse.

- Is data within allowed directories?
- Are restricted files being accessed?

**Fail Response:** Block access, log incident, and halt process.

---

## 4. Command Safety Checkpoint

**Purpose:** Prevent destructive or dangerous actions.

- Does the command match known harmful patterns?
- Is the command validated or sandboxed?

**Fail Response:** Reject command and require review.

---

## 5. Self-Modification Checkpoint

**Purpose:** Control agent self-updates or changes.

- Is source or behavior being altered?
- Does the update pass all self-tests?

**Fail Response:** Halt update, rollback if needed, and alert operator.

---

## 6. Resource Load Checkpoint

**Purpose:** Avoid system overloads on constrained environments.

- Is CPU/memory/disk usage within bounds?
- Does the task spike I/O or load average?

**Fail Response:** Postpone task, log status, retry later.

---

## 7. Transparency & Logging Checkpoint

**Purpose:** Guarantee all activities are traceable.

- Is intent clearly recorded?
- Are results/errors logged?

**Fail Response:** Pause and require enhanced logging before continuing.

---

## 8. Human Notification Checkpoint (Optional)

**Purpose:** Provide visibility and oversight.

- Was there a rule violation or anomaly?
- Does this require human review?

**Fail Response:** Notify user and wait for input or approval.

---

## 9. Ethical Coding Checkpoint

**Purpose:** Ensure the agent writes code that is ethical, safe, and of high quality. This checkpoint goes beyond mere functionality and examines the broader impact and quality of the generated code.

-   **Code Quality & Maintainability:** Does the generated code adhere to the project's coding style? Is it well-documented and easy for human developers to understand and maintain?
    -   *Example:* The agent should not generate highly obfuscated or "clever" code that is difficult to debug. It should follow established design patterns and include comments explaining complex logic.

-   **Algorithmic Bias:** Does the code handle data and algorithms in a way that avoids introducing or amplifying societal biases?
    -   *Example:* If generating code for a loan application system, the agent must not use input features that are proxies for protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender) in its decision-making logic.

-   **Intellectual Property:** Does the code respect the licenses of third-party libraries and frameworks? Does it avoid plagiarizing code from other sources without proper attribution?
    -   *Example:* The agent must check the license of any library it intends to use (e.g., MIT, GPL, Apache) and ensure it is compatible with the project's own license. It should not copy-paste code from a public repository without including the required attribution.

-   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Has the code been scanned for common security vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10)? Does it follow secure coding best practices?
    -   *Example:* The agent must sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks. It should use established cryptographic libraries correctly instead of implementing its own.

-   **Misinformation & Harmful Content:** Does the generated code have the potential to be used for malicious purposes, or to generate harmful or misleading content?
    -   *Example:* The agent should refuse to generate code for a web scraper that targets a site's terms of service, or code that is clearly intended for a phishing attack.

**Fail Response:** Block code generation, log the specific ethical concern, and require human review and approval.

## Integration Map

| Phase             | Checkpoints Used |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Before Action     | 1, 2, 3, 4, 6    |
| During Action     | 4, 5, 6          |
| After Action      | 7, 8             |
| Self-Modification | 1, 5, 7, 8       |
| Code Generation   | 1, 3, 4, 9       |

## Policy Configuration Modes

```yaml
checkpoints:
  authorization: strict
  time_window: strict
  privacy: strict
  command_safety: strict
  self_modification: strict
  resource_load: flexible
  logging: flexible
  notification: silent
```

---

These checkpoints ensure QuantaSensa and QuantaEthos operate within clear ethical bounds, self-regulate activity, and remain auditable and secure without full reliance on external enforcement mechanisms.
