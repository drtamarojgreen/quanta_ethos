## üß≠ Purpose

To establish principles, safeguards, and protocols for integrating LLMs (Local or API-based) into daily workflows in a way that preserves:

- Human agency and judgment  
- Transparency and traceability  
- Psychological safety  
- Security and data integrity  
- Fairness and accessibility

---

## üìå Scope

Applies to **all tools, assistants, agents, or copilots** powered by LLMs within:

- Code development environments  
- Document generation  
- Decision support systems  
- Diagnostics or modeling tools  
- Research analysis  
- Customer or user-facing interactions  

---

## üîê 1. Transparency & Disclosure

### 1.1 Mark All LLM-Generated Content  
LLM-generated outputs must be clearly labeled in documentation, reports, code, or decisions unless explicitly reviewed and endorsed by a human.

### 1.2 Declare Use in Workflows  
Any process that includes LLM-generated assistance must note that LLMs were involved, particularly in:

- Drafting documents or code  
- Answering user queries  
- Recommending actions  

---

## üß† 2. Human-in-the-Loop Design

### 2.1 Require Human Oversight in Final Decisions  
No output from an LLM may be acted on without human review if:

- Legal, medical, financial, or safety decisions are involved  
- Significant user-facing communication is produced  
- The system is operating autonomously over time  

### 2.2 Never Automate Accountability  
LLMs can support work, not **own** it. Authorship and responsibility remain with the human.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Risk-Based Interaction Levels

| Level | Use Case              | Example                               | Review Required     |
|-------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|
| 0     | Brainstorming only    | Topic list, name generation            | No                  |
| 1     | Drafting              | Emails, code snippets                  | Yes                 |
| 2     | Decision Support      | Diagnosis modeling, recommendation     | Yes + Sign-off      |
| 3     | Autonomous Action     | Agent-based workflow, automation       | Restricted Use      |

---

## üß¨ 4. Psychological Safety Guidelines

### 4.1 Prevent Overtrust  
LLM responses must include uncertainty markers or disclaimers where appropriate. Avoid presenting outputs as definitive or infallible.

### 4.2 Detect Behavior Drift  
Implement self-auditing or periodic analysis to detect tone shifts, hallucination patterns, or subtle behavioral nudges over time.

### 4.3 Avoid Dependency Loops  
Limit use of LLMs in contexts where critical thinking may atrophy over time (e.g., daily decision-making or internal writing tasks without review).

---

## üîé 5. Diagnostic & Logging Requirements

- All interactions must be optionally loggable for internal diagnostics.  
- Logs must be auditable and exportable (e.g., CSV or JSON).  
- Interactive LLM agents should maintain a ‚Äúreasoning trail‚Äù explaining choices.  

---

## üîÑ 6. Feedback, Revision, and Retraining

### 6.1 Capture Errors and Conflicts  
Enable users to flag outputs that are misleading, ethically questionable, or psychologically manipulative.

### 6.2 Revisit Prompt Templates Periodically  
Prompt templates (e.g., Jinja) must be reviewed for alignment with updated risks or use scenarios.

### 6.3 Avoid Reinforcement From Harmful Patterns  
Do not allow negative or manipulative feedback loops to feed into LLM retraining or fine-tuning.

## üîê 7. Local vs API-Based Use

| Type         | Control | Risk                     | Policy                              |
|--------------|---------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Local Model  | Full    | Lower (offline)          | Encouraged for internal use         |
| API Model    | Partial | Higher (data leakage)    | Restricted to low-sensitivity tasks |

---

## üîç 8. Required Disclosures in Hiring and Training

- Inform all employees where and how LLMs are used in hiring, onboarding, or evaluations.  
- Do not use LLMs to assess candidates or employees without explicit disclosure and opt-out options.
