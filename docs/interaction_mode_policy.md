# Interaction Mode Policy for Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Purpose  
To identify and analyze the psychological, developmental, and safety risks associated with different modes of interaction with LLMs, and to recommend safeguards for responsible use now and in the future.

---

## Current Interaction Modes and Risks

### Voice-Activated LLMs  
- Passive, ambient interaction often via smart speakers or voice assistants.  
- Stronger emotional bonds due to human-like voice and conversational tone, increasing risk of attachment displacement especially in children.  
- Privacy concerns due to ambient listening and unintentional activation.  
- Difficult for parents or guardians to monitor usage, especially in shared environments.  
- Low cognitive load for input can lead to uncritical acceptance of information.  

### Mobile Chat LLMs  
- Active, tactile engagement requiring typing and reading responses.  
- Moderate emotional impact due to text-based, less immersive communication.  
- Personal devices allow some monitoring but risk secretive or prolonged use.  
- Moderate cognitive load encourages more conscious interaction.  
- Portable nature can lead to high usage frequency and potential dependence.  

### Computer Chat LLMs  
- Typically used in focused, deliberate contexts such as work or study.  
- Lower emotional bonding risk due to professional or academic use.  
- Institutional monitoring possible, increasing accountability but also raising privacy concerns.  
- Higher cognitive load promotes critical thinking and deliberate inquiry.  
- Risk of over-reliance remains if users defer judgment too readily.

## Emerging and Future Interaction Modes

### Multimodal Interfaces  
- Integration of voice, text, gestures, facial expressions, and environmental sensors.  
- Potential for deeper emotional engagement and richer contextual understanding.  
- Presents opportunities for enhanced safeguards but also increases complexity of misuse.  

### Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) Integration  
- Immersive experiences where LLMs take form of avatars or environment guides.  
- Heightened risks of emotional attachment, social isolation, and blurred reality boundaries.  
- Addiction and detachment from real-world relationships become major concerns.  

### Wearable and Implantable Devices  
- Continuous, always-on LLM support with minimal user input required.  
- Raises profound privacy, consent, and mental health questions.  
- Necessitates strict regulatory frameworks and transparency mechanisms.  

### Collaborative AI Agents  
- Multiple LLMs coordinating among themselves or working alongside humans.  
- Challenges around trust, accountability, decision ownership, and error propagation.  
- Risk of diffused responsibility and human over-trust in complex systems.

## Recommendations for Policy and Safeguards

- Develop and enforce modality-specific usage restrictions and age-appropriate controls.  
- Provide clear, persistent transparency indicators informing users of LLM activity and limitations.  
- Implement session duration limits and mandatory cooldowns tailored to interaction mode.  
- Design parental, guardian, and institutional monitoring and alert tools suitable for each modality.  
- Invest in ongoing research to anticipate risks from new interaction paradigms and adapt safeguards proactively.
