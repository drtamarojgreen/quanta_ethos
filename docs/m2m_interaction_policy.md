# LLM to LLM Interaction Policy

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the policy and guidelines for interactions between Large Language Models (LLMs) and other autonomous agents. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all machine-to-machine (M2M) interactions are clear, efficient, secure, and robust.

## 2. Core Principles

All LLM interactions should adhere to the following core principles:

*   **Clarity and Precision**: Communication should be unambiguous and precise. Use of structured data formats is required.
*   **Efficiency**: Interactions should be designed to minimize computational resources and latency. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.
*   **Verifiability**: All information exchanged should be verifiable. When presenting information, an LLM should provide its sources or a method to verify the information.
*   **Security**: All interactions must be secure. This includes authentication, authorization, and protection against malicious inputs.
*   **Graceful Degradation and Error Handling**: LLMs should be designed to handle errors gracefully and provide clear error messages.

## 3. Interaction Protocols

A standardized protocol shall be used for all M2M interactions.

### Request/Response Format

All interactions should use a JSON-based request/response format.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "sender_id": "string",
  "receiver_id": "string",
  "task_id": "string",
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 string",
  "payload": {
    "task_type": "string",
    "data": {}
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "sender_id": "string",
  "receiver_id": "string",
  "task_id": "string",
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 string",
  "status": "success|error",
  "payload": {
    "data": {},
    "error": {
      "code": "string",
      "message": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Data Formatting

*   **Structured Data**: All data exchanged between LLMs must be in a structured format, preferably JSON.
*   **Schema Definition**: A clear schema should be defined for each `task_type` to ensure that both the sender and receiver have a common understanding of the data being exchanged.

## 5. Security Considerations

*   **Authentication and Authorization**: Each LLM must be authenticated before it can interact with another LLM. API keys, OAuth tokens, or other standard authentication methods should be used.
*   **Input Sanitization**: All incoming data must be sanitized to prevent injection attacks or other malicious inputs.
*   **Data Encryption**: All data transmitted between LLMs should be encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols like TLS.

## 6. Error Handling

*   **Standardized Error Codes**: A set of standardized error codes should be used to indicate the nature of an error.
*   **Clear Error Messages**: Error messages should be clear, concise, and provide enough information for debugging.

## 7. Versioning

APIs and interaction protocols should be versioned. When a breaking change is introduced, a new version of the protocol should be released to ensure backward compatibility. Versioning should be handled through the API endpoint (e.g., `/api/v2/...`).
